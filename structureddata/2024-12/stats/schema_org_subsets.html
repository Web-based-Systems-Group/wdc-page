<h1>Class-Specific Subsets of the Schema.org Data contained in the October 2024 Corpus</h1>
<p>This page provides access to and statistics about class-specific subsets of the <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a>
    data contained in the <a href="http://webdatacommons.org/structureddata/2024-12/stats/stats.html">October 2024
        version</a> of the <a href="http://webdatacommons.org/structureddata/">Web Data Commons Microdata and JSON-LD
        corpus</a>.
    The datasets are part of the <a href="/structureddata/schemaorg/">Web Data Commons Schema.org Data Set Series</a>
</p>

<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p>
    As many users are only interested in specific types of Schema.org data (like product data, event data, job postings,
    or data describing local businesses), we have created class-specific subsets out of the complete and merged <a
        href="http://webdatacommons.org/structureddata/2024-12/stats/stats.html">Microdata and JSON-LD corpora</a> for a
    selection of <i>schema.org</i> classes.
    The subsets contain all instances of a specific class of either formats as well as all other data that is found on
    the webpages containing these instances. For example, a page containing data about a product might also contain
    reviews and offers for this product; a page containing data about an event might also contain data about the
    location of the event and the persons involved in the event.
    The data is represented in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/">N-Quads</a> format, meaning that the forth
    element of each quad contains the URL of the webpage from which the data was extracted.
    To facilitate the download and access to the class specific data, we provide the schema.org subsets in chunks. Each
    chunk contains quads of specific pay-level-domains (PLDs), i.e. all quads of one PLD, e.g. yummly.com,
    are organized within the same chunk file. Additionally, we provide lookup files containing the mappings between PLDs
    and their corresponding chunks as well as csv files with PLD-specific statistics.
    <br>

</p>


<p><b>Please note that: </b>
<ul>
    <li> the merged Microdata and JSON-LD corpora are not deduplicated, i.e. if a schema.org/Product entity is annotated
        on the same page with both formats, it will appear twice on the merged Product schema.org subset.
    </li>
    <li> considering the general trend towards using 'https' more widely, the schema.org subsets of the 2024 extraction
        contain entities annotated with both 'http' and 'https', e.g. http://schema.org/Product and
        https://schema.org/Product.
    </li>
    <li>the data in the files is not disjunct. This means that whenever you combine two files you might end up with
        duplicated quads, as one webpage can contain more than one class (e.g. schema.org/Product and schema.org/Offer).
    </li>
    <li>the data is only the tip of the iceberg. The <a href="http://commoncrawl.org/">CommonCrawl</a> covers only a
        subset of all webpages that are offered by a specific website. Thus, only a subset of all data offered by a site
        is contained in our corpus. If you need more instances of a specific class, you will need to crawl deeper into
        the websites that we identified to contain specific types of Schema.org data.
    </li>
</ul>

    In case you are interested in a particular class or set of classes which is not listed above, please get in contact
    with the WebDataCommons team via <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/web-data-commons">Mailing List</a> or our

<h2>Conversion to Other Formats</h2>
<p>
    We provide the extracted data for download using a variation of the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/">N-Quads</a> format. For users who prefer other formats, we provide code
    for converting the download files into CSV and JSON formats, which are supported by
    a wide range of spreadsheet applications, relational databases and data mining frameworks like the python data
    analysis library pandas. Please find further details on how to convert the download files to other formats on the <a
        href="../../?#toc17">main page</a>.

    The jupyter notebooks used to create the schema.org subsets from the MD and JSON-LD corpus can be checked out from
    our <a href="https://github.com/wbsg-uni-mannheim/SubsetCreatorJupyterNBs.git"> Git repository</a>.
</p>


<p>
    The extraction of December 2024 was done with <a
        href="https://github.com/Web-based-Systems-Group/WDCFramework">version 1.5 of the
    extractor</a>. For more information about the framework and a detailed description how to run a own extraction visit
